Hello everybody learning to become an SDET *(Software Development Engineer in Test or Software Design Engineer in Test).*
Daniel, Stephanie, Sobirdzhon, Livio and Daria, Cybertek school student Batch 21 group 28, welcoming you to our application!

This is a web based application which will help you to practice interview questions as an individual or in a group play.
As of right now it's in a very raw state. Currently it's best played from phone. Desktop version will be developed later.
If you follow along you will see how new modules will be added. Please check out Project section to see Kanban board.

We are using Agile Kanban methodology in this project, so we are open to your precious feedback regarding existing or future functionalities.
Please feel free to leave your comments, questions, concerns in discussion section of this repository. We will respond to your ASAP.

The idea of this game belogs to Stephanie.
In collaboration with Daniel, Livio and Daria we created Java + Selenium based application. 
Please check out our repository "here" *link will be here after we present our project in student-mentoring session at 2/8/21 9:00 pm est.* 
In collaboration with all of us and Sobirdzhon now we work in creating web based version of the application.
