Hello everybody learning to become an SDET *(Software Development Engineer in Test or Software Design Engineer in Test).*

This is a web based application which will help you to practice interview questions as an individual or in a group play.
As of right now it's in a very raw state. Currently it's best played from phone. Desktop version will be developed later.
If you follow along you will see how new modules will be added. Please check out Project section to see Kanban board.

I'm using Agile Kanban methodology in this project, so I'm open to your precious feedback regarding existing or future functionalities.
Please feel free to leave your comments in discussion section of this repository.

The idea of this game belogs to Livio, Daniel and Stephanie, Cybertek school students Batch 21 group 28. 
In collaboration with Daria they created Java + Selenium based application. 
Please check out their repository "here" *link will be here after they present their project in student-mentoring session at 2/8/21 9:00 pm est.* 
With their permission I use their idea and resources to create web based version of their application.
